-------------------
C:\react\demo-repo>git remote add origin git@github.com:Annie-Huang/demo-repo.git	<< Creat the linkage
C:\react\demo-repo>git remote -v							<< List which remote repo your directory is linked to

Method 2: the git repo is already created by someone and you have to clone it.

        index.html


C:\react\demo-repo>git add index.html		<< get git to track a specific file
C:\react\demo-repo>git add .			<< get git to track all the untrack files
C:\react\demo-repo>git status
Changes to be committed:

Enter file in which to save the key (C:\Users\Annie/.ssh/id_rsa): testkey	<< If you choose a name it will generate: testkey and testkey.pub in your current dir

C:\react\demo-repo>git push origin master	<< push to master branch
C:\react\demo-repo>git push -u origin master	<< set up default upstream so I don't need to type 'origin master' everytime.

        README.md			<< in red color


C:\react\demo-repo>git add .
C:\react\demo-repo>git status
        modified:   README.md		<< in green color
If you modify README.md again:
C:\react\demo-repo>git status
        modified:   README.md		<< in green color, the one you add before still in green
        modified:   README.md		<< in red color, the one you just modified will be in red. You will need to "git add ." again if you want to commit both changes
